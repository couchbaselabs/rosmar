# Rosmar

**Rosmar** is an upgraded rewrite of **Walrus**, a lightweight database back-end for Couchbase Sync Gateway.

Rosmar uses SQLite, so it is persistent by default, though it can use an in-memory database.

Rosmar supports:

* Collections
* Xattrs
* Subdocuments
* DCP feeds

Rosmar does not support:

* N1QL

(The word _Rosmar_ is Norwegian for "walrus".)
